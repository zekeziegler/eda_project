Are there any notable data quality issues? Find out if there are missing values in the data and think of how you can handle them. Are there any surprising relationships between the dimensions/variables? Make sure to perform sanity checks for patterns you expect to see! Note that it may be the case that after doing a bit of exploration in phase 1 you find that your data is not as interesting as you first thought. In such cases you might consider returning to Part 1 and identifying a different dataset to work with. Such iteration on choosing the dataset is common, but also time-consuming, so make sure you leave time in your schedule for this.\n",

        "**Phase 2:** Next, you should investigate your initial questions, as well as any new questions that arise during your exploration. For each question, create a visualization that might provide a useful answer. Then refine the visualization (by adding additional variables, changing the sort ordering or axis scales, filtering or subsetting data, etc.) to develop better perspectives explore unexpected observations, or sanity check your assumptions. You should repeat this process for each of your questions, and also feel free to revise your questions or branch off to explore new questions as the data warrants."
